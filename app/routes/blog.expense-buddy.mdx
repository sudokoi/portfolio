# {frontmatter.title}

I’ve tried a bunch of expense trackers over the years, and I kept running into the same problems: slow flows, cluttered screens, and a nagging feeling that I was handing over more data than I should. So I built my own.

Expense Buddy is a privacy‑first, local‑first expense tracker that stays out of your way. It’s built with React Native (Expo), keeps everything on‑device by default, and gives you **optional GitHub sync** if you want a personal backup you control.

## Why Expense Buddy exists

Most expense trackers either felt slow, intrusive, or vague about where my data lived. I wanted something simple enough to open daily, fast enough to never frustrate me, and honest about storage. Expense Buddy is the result—focused on clarity, speed, and ownership:

- **Local-first** by default (your data stays on-device)
- **Private** by design (no analytics, ads, or data selling)
- **Fast** on large datasets with a lightweight UI
- **In your control** with optional GitHub sync to your own repo

## Feature highlights

- **Daily expense tracking** with category and payment method tags
- **Edit expenses** anytime with a full **history view** to revisit and update past entries
- **Smart GitHub sync** with incremental, differential, and batched commits
- **Analytics that go deeper**: category and payment method breakdowns, instrument‑level splits, plus a spending trend chart
- **Custom categories** with colors and icons
- **Saved payment instruments** (cards and UPI IDs)
- **In‑app update notes** with a “What’s New” sheet after updates
- **Issue reporting** directly from Settings
- **Light and dark mode** with theme‑aware styling

## Dashboard

The dashboard is my “daily check‑in” screen. It gives me a quick view of recent spending and a simple 7‑day trend. I made the graph tappable because I kept wanting to jump straight into that day’s entries.

<div className="my-6 flex flex-wrap items-start justify-center gap-4">
  <img
    src="/assets/expense-buddy/expense-buddy-dashboard.jpeg"
    alt="Expense Buddy dashboard"
    className="h-auto w-full max-w-[240px] rounded-lg border border-secondary"
  />
</div>

## Add expense

Adding an expense should be boring—in a good way. It’s a one‑screen flow with quick category and payment method picks so I can log something in a few seconds and move on.

<div className="my-6 flex flex-wrap items-start justify-center gap-4">
  <img
    src="/assets/expense-buddy/expense-buddy-add-new-expense.jpeg"
    alt="Expense Buddy add expense screen"
    className="h-auto w-full max-w-[240px] rounded-lg border border-secondary"
  />
</div>

## Analytics you can trust

I wanted answers, not charts for the sake of charts. The analytics tab helps me see where money goes by **category**, **payment method**, and **saved instrument**, then zoom out with a **spending trend** view. I also added multiple **time windows** so I can compare “this week” vs. “the last 3 months” without leaving the screen.

<div className="my-6 flex flex-wrap items-start justify-center gap-4">
  <img
    src="/assets/expense-buddy/expense-buddy-analytics.jpeg"
    alt="Expense Buddy analytics"
    className="h-auto w-full max-w-[240px] rounded-lg border border-secondary"
  />
  <img
    src="/assets/expense-buddy/expense-buddy-analytics-2.jpeg"
    alt="Expense Buddy analytics charts"
    className="h-auto w-full max-w-[240px] rounded-lg border border-secondary"
  />
</div>

## History and edits

I mess up entries all the time. The history view lets me browse past entries, open any expense, and fix it in place—no weird edit mode, no hunting.

<div className="my-6 flex flex-wrap items-start justify-center gap-4">
  <img
    src="/assets/expense-buddy/expense-buddy-history.jpeg"
    alt="Expense Buddy history"
    className="h-auto w-full max-w-[240px] rounded-lg border border-secondary"
  />
</div>

## Settings that stay out of your way

Settings are intentionally boring. You can set a **default payment method**, add **custom categories** (the app ships with 8 defaults you can edit), manage **saved payment instruments** for deeper analytics, and enable **GitHub sync** to keep everything in sync across devices. Auto‑sync can run **on change** or **on app launch**.

<div className="my-6 flex flex-wrap items-start justify-center gap-4">
  <img
    src="/assets/expense-buddy/expense-buddy-settings.jpeg"
    alt="Expense Buddy settings"
    className="h-auto w-full max-w-[240px] rounded-lg border border-secondary"
  />
  <img
    src="/assets/expense-buddy/expense-buddy-settings-2.jpeg"
    alt="Expense Buddy settings auto-sync"
    className="h-auto w-full max-w-[240px] rounded-lg border border-secondary"
  />
</div>

## How GitHub sync works (optional)

I designed GitHub sync to be safe, predictable, and fully optional. Your data stays local unless you explicitly turn this on.

- **Daily CSV files**: expenses are stored as `expenses-YYYY-MM-DD.csv` in your repo
- **Merge‑first workflow**: fetch → merge → push, to avoid accidental data loss
- **Conflict handling**: timestamp‑based resolution, with true conflict prompts only when needed
- **Differential uploads**: only changed files are uploaded, and changes are **batched into a single commit**
- **Settings sync** (optional): categories and saved instruments can be synced via `settings.json`

## Built for speed

I’m allergic to janky lists, so performance was a first‑class goal. Virtualized lists, memoized components, and a lightweight state layer keep things snappy even with long histories. The UI stays minimal so logging an expense takes seconds, not minutes.

## Privacy notes

- No required external accounts to use the app
- GitHub sync is **opt‑in** and stores files in your own repository (daily CSVs)
- No selling of data
