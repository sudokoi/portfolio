# {frontmatter.title}

Expense Buddy is a privacy‑first expense tracker for people who want a fast, reliable way to log daily spending without ads or hidden data collection. It’s built with React Native (Expo), stores everything locally by default, and offers optional GitHub sync if you want a personal backup you control.

## Why Expense Buddy exists

Most expense trackers either feel slow, intrusive, or opaque about where your data goes. Expense Buddy is the opposite—focused on clarity, speed, and ownership:

- **Local-first** by default (your data stays on-device)
- **Private** by design (no analytics, ads, or data selling)
- **Fast** on large datasets with a lightweight UI
- **In your control** with optional GitHub sync to your own repo

## Feature highlights

- **Daily expense tracking** with category and payment method tags
- **Edit expenses** anytime with a full **history view** to revisit and update past entries
- **Smart GitHub sync** with incremental, differential, and batched commits
- **Analytics that go deeper**: category and payment method breakdowns, instrument‑level splits, plus a spending trend chart
- **Custom categories** with colors and icons
- **Saved payment instruments** (cards and UPI IDs)
- **In‑app update notes** with a “What’s New” sheet after updates
- **Issue reporting** directly from Settings
- **Light and dark mode** with theme‑aware styling

## Dashboard

The dashboard gives you quick insights into recent transactions, total spend, and the last 7‑day trend. Tapping the 7‑day graph jumps straight into the day‑view expenses.

    alt="Expense Buddy dashboard"
    className="h-auto w-full max-w-[240px] rounded-lg border border-secondary"
  />
</div>

## Add expense

Adding an expense is a one‑screen flow with quick category and payment method picks, designed to stay out of your way while you’re on the go.

<div className="my-6 flex flex-wrap items-start justify-center gap-4">
  <img
    src="/assets/expense-buddy/expense-buddy-add-new-expense.jpeg"
    alt="Expense Buddy add expense screen"
    className="h-auto w-full max-w-[240px] rounded-lg border border-secondary"
  />
</div>

## Analytics you can trust

The analytics tab is built for quick answers: see where money goes by **category**, **payment method**, and **saved instrument**, then zoom out with a **spending trend** view. You can also filter by multiple **time windows** to compare recent weeks vs. longer‑term habits.

    alt="Expense Buddy analytics"
    className="h-auto w-full max-w-[240px] rounded-lg border border-secondary"
  />
  <img

    alt="Expense Buddy analytics charts"
    className="h-auto w-full max-w-[240px] rounded-lg border border-secondary"
  />
</div>

## History and edits

Need to fix a mistake? The history view lets you browse past entries, open any expense, and edit it in place.

<div className="my-6 flex flex-wrap items-start justify-center gap-4">
  <img
    src="/assets/expense-buddy/expense-buddy-history.jpeg"
    alt="Expense Buddy history"
    className="h-auto w-full max-w-[240px] rounded-lg border border-secondary"
  />
</div>

## Settings that stay out of your way

The Settings screen is meant to be practical, not noisy. You can set a **default payment method**, add **custom categories** (the app ships with 8 defaults you can edit), manage **saved payment instruments** for deeper analytics, and enable **GitHub sync** to keep everything in sync across devices. Auto‑sync can run **on change** or **on app launch**.

<div className="my-6 flex flex-wrap items-start justify-center gap-4">
  <img
    src="/assets/expense-buddy/expense-buddy-settings.jpeg"
    alt="Expense Buddy settings"
    className="h-auto w-full max-w-[240px] rounded-lg border border-secondary"
  />
  <img
    src="/assets/expense-buddy/expense-buddy-settings-2.jpeg"
    alt="Expense Buddy settings auto-sync"
    className="h-auto w-full max-w-[240px] rounded-lg border border-secondary"
  />
</div>

## How GitHub sync works (optional)

GitHub sync is designed to be safe, predictable, and in your control. Your data stays local unless you explicitly enable sync.

- **Daily CSV files**: expenses are stored as `expenses-YYYY-MM-DD.csv` in your repo
- **Merge‑first workflow**: fetch → merge → push, to avoid accidental data loss
- **Conflict handling**: timestamp‑based resolution, with true conflict prompts only when needed
- **Differential uploads**: only changed files are uploaded, and changes are **batched into a single commit**
- **Settings sync** (optional): categories and saved instruments can be synced via `settings.json`

## Built for speed

Expense Buddy stays snappy even with large histories thanks to virtualized lists, memoized components, and a lightweight state layer. The UI is intentionally minimal so adding an expense takes seconds, not minutes.

## Privacy notes

- No required external accounts to use the app
- GitHub sync is **opt‑in** and stores files in your own repository (daily CSVs)
- No selling of data
